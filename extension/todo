Bugfixes
[X] parse error on connection differences
[X] deleting a connection does not clear the role on the fact.
[X] svg export: direction of verbilisation is not coloured.
[X] deleting a fact does not remove the constraints
[X] after adding constraint, fact is not reselected
[X] connections still in file after being deleted
[X] Lables over facts are not centered
[X] bug with derived label not updating.
[X] connections not connecting with facts, layout may not be considering last edit correctly
[X] document parse error, after an inital document is loaded and a new save trigger occurs; error in canvas finding the same entity.
[X] bug with the fact labels, trigger derived without label, labels wont change
[X] bugfix, element.out on dragging not progatting on default priority 
[X] labels on facts are not reactive; create derivation label; change base label content; no change
[X] labels on facts are not updating position after fact expansion
[-] positions of elements seem to change when reading in a document (only one or two arent or are offset)
    [X] fixed a version of this bug due to objectification, likely other offsets are needed :/
[X] when fact is expanded/reduced the connections for remainding connections are not updated
[X] command to create a new orm model does not work
[X] document diffing is not working, something to do with object assignment on readonly
    [X] Cannot convert undefined or null to object
    [X] loading an empty file causes a parse error (should not be triggered at all)
[?] laying out for intersections are a bit off, seems like intersection with shapes need to be revisited
[X] editing opens after file load, should be closed after load
[X] Mandatory constraints on fact connections need to be closer to the entity
[X] layouting can error out in cases where intersection is not possible, need a fallthrough case.
