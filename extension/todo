Bugfixes
[X] parse error on connection differences
[X] deleting a connection does not clear the role on the fact.
[X] svg export: direction of verbilisation is not coloured.
[X] deleting a fact does not remove the constraints
[X] after adding constraint, fact is not reselected
[X] connections still in file after being deleted
[X] Lables over facts are not centered
[X] bug with derived label not updating.
[X] connections not connecting with facts, layout may not be considering last edit correctly

[X] bugfix, element.out on dragging not progatting on default priority 
[ ] labels on facts are not reactive; create derivation label; change base label content; no change
